## Research Experience

### **Cosmological data analysis with simulation-based inference and machine learning techniques** `2022.6 - present`

_Master's Research  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Advisor: Dr. Christoph Weniger_<br>
In this project, I employ a machine learning based technique, Truncated Marginal Neural Ratio Estimation (TMNRE) to analyze CMB data. For simple cosmological models such as Î›CDM, it is fast and convenient to use conventional sampling-based methods such as MCMC to infer the parameters. However, MCMC scales poorly with dimensionality for extended cosmological models. In this case, simulation-based inference such as TMNRE is a powerful tool. Here I consider a phenomenological early dark energy model (Ye et al. 2020) with extended parameters. I am using modified CLASS codes to define a simulator with noise and employing TMNRE to infer the cosmological parameters of this model.


### **Holographic derivation of the island formula for reflected entropy** `2021.1 - 2021.8`

_Undergraduate Research  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Advisor: Prof. Yang Zhou_<br>
This research produces the publications 1 & 2. We employ the quantum gravity model proposed in our previous work to give a holographic derivation of the island formula for reflected entropy. More precisely, we demonstrate that the entropy calculated on the boundary side is equivalent to a bulk quantity called "defect extremal cross section" by combining the partial Randall-Sundrum reduction and holographic duality. We find perfect agreement in both static and time-dependent scenarios. 


### **Machine learning of phase transitions in spin models** `2019.8 - 2019.12`

_Undergraduate Research  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Advisor: Prof. Yan Chen_<br>
The draft of this project is [here](https://github.com/tianyi-phys-ml/tianyi-phys-ml.github.io). We apply machine learning methods to study the phase transition in XY model and 3-dimensional Ising model. Samples of the model at different temperature, distributed on both sides of the critical point, are generated by the Monte Carlo algorithm. By exemplifying and simulating the XY model, we exhibit a new method, which integrates Monte Carlo, VAE and neural network algorithm to help describe the phase transition and accurately estimate their critical point.


###  **Optimization of quantum computation algorithms based on reinforcement learning**

_Undergraduate Research  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Advisor: Prof. Xiaopeng Li_<br>
Adiabatic quantum algorithms play an important role in quantum computation. However, it is very difficult to design an effective adiabatic evolution path of the Hamiltonian which encodes the problem to be solved. I followed the paper arXiv:1812.10797 and successfully developed the reinforcement learning code which is able to automatically generate an effective Hamiltonian path. In addition, I implemented a transfer learning mechanism to optimize the convergence of this algorithm.


## Research Interest
I have a wide interest in cosmology, particle physics and high energy theory.<br>
<br>
**Cosmology and Particle Physics**: I am interested in using astrophysical observations to find signals of physics beyond the Standard Model and know more about the dark universe. Based on my experience in machine learning, I am especially interested in applying these ML techniques to the analysis of the data collected from new observational approaches.<br>
**High Energy Theory**: I have interest in many topics in AdS/CFT. Two of my past research experience focused on the black hole information paradox from the perspective of holography. I am also interested in the interplay between quantum information and quantum gravity, topics of ensemble average in holography, and quantum gravity in de Sitter, etc.
